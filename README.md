# Kinematic Interpolation using Machine Learning
The sample code and sample trial are supplementary materials for the manuscript to be submitted to Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering entitled: Brenneman EC, Gatti AA, Hurley JN, Maly MR. Machine Learning with Circular Solution Space Reconstruction Outperforms Spline Interpolation in Cluster Marker Reconstruction During Gait. 
The sample trial contains x, y, and z global position of 3 rigid body cluster markers on the shank.  Data from 250 ms prior-to heel-strike to 250 ms following the subsequent heel-strike (one full gait cycle with padded data points on either end) were extracted.  The sampling rate was 100 Hz.  For the user input in the Matlab command window, type a positive integer <26.  This number reflects the number of missing frames of data the moving window will treat.  Since the padded data on either end of the gait cycle is 250 ms (25 frames), using missing data durations greater than 25 will result in errors normalizing the resulting RSME curve to % gait cycle.  To investigate longer durations of missing data, simply alter the code to your preference.
